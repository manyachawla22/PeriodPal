Menstruation is the monthly process in which the uterus sheds its lining, causing bleeding from the vagina. This bleeding usually lasts between 3 and 7 days.

A normal menstrual cycle usually lasts between 21 and 35 days. Day 1 of the cycle is the first day of bleeding.

Periods happen because pregnancy did not occur in the previous cycle, so the body no longer needs the uterine lining.

Menarche is the first period, which usually occurs between ages 10 and 16. It is a normal sign that the body is maturing.

Menopause marks the end of menstruation and usually happens between ages 45 and 52.

The menstrual cycle has four phases: the menstrual phase (bleeding), the follicular phase (egg develops), ovulation (egg release), and the luteal phase (body prepares for pregnancy).

Hormones like estrogen and progesterone control the menstrual cycle and cause changes throughout the month.
