Menstrual hygiene means using clean products, changing them regularly, and maintaining personal cleanliness during periods.

Common menstrual products include pads, tampons, and menstrual cups.

Pads are worn outside the body and should be changed every 4–6 hours to prevent rashes and infection.

Tampons are placed inside the vagina and should not be worn for more than 8 hours to reduce infection risk.

Menstrual cups are reusable devices that collect blood and can be worn for up to 10–12 hours if cleaned properly.

Good hygiene includes washing hands before and after changing products and having access to clean water and soap.

Safe disposal or cleaning of menstrual products helps prevent infection and protects the environment.

Learning about menstrual hygiene improves comfort, confidence, and health during periods.
