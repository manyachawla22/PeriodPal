Irregular periods mean that cycle length, bleeding amount, or duration changes often.

A cycle may be considered irregular if periods come too frequently, are very far apart, last too long, or are very short.

Common causes of irregular periods include stress, sudden weight changes, excessive exercise, and hormonal imbalance.

Medical causes may include polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid problems, or hormonal disorders.

Heavy or prolonged bleeding can occur due to fibroids, polyps, or hormonal imbalance.

Light or missing periods may happen during puberty, before menopause, or due to conditions affecting hormones.

Certain medications, birth control methods, or IUDs can also affect cycle regularity.

Tracking cycle patterns helps identify changes and can support medical evaluation if needed.
