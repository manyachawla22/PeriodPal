Menstrual cramps are caused by uterine contractions and the release of prostaglandins. Mild exercise, heat packs, and NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) can help relieve cramps.

Period irregularities: Stress, significant weight change, thyroid issues, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can cause irregular periods. If periods are consistently irregular, consult a healthcare professional.

Heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be due to hormonal imbalance, uterine fibroids, or other medical conditions. Track the flow and consult a doctor if you soak through one or more pads/tampons every hour for several hours.

Headaches before periods are often linked to hormonal fluctuations, especially drops in estrogen and serotonin. Stay hydrated and consult a doctor if migraines are severe.

When to see a doctor: if you have severe pain not relieved by OTC meds, very heavy bleeding, fever, or signs of infection, seek medical care promptly.
