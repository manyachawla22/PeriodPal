Menstrual cramps are caused by contractions of the uterus as it sheds its lining during a period.

These contractions are triggered by chemicals called prostaglandins. Higher levels of prostaglandins usually cause stronger pain.

Primary cramps are common and not linked to disease. They often begin soon after periods start and improve with age.

Secondary cramps are caused by underlying conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, or infections.

Pain relief options include painkillers like ibuprofen or naproxen, which reduce inflammation and cramps.

Using a heating pad on the lower abdomen can help relax muscles and reduce pain.

Regular exercise and stretching may reduce cramps for some people.

If cramps are severe, sudden, or do not improve with treatment, medical evaluation may be needed.
